# Cypress with page object model template.

This repository serves as a template for setting up Cypress tests using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications, and the POM pattern helps in organizing and maintaining tests by abstracting the interactions with UI elements into reusable components.

### Features

- Page Object Model (POM): Organize your Cypress tests into reusable page objects, making them more maintainable and easier to understand.

- Example Tests: Includes an example test suite that demonstrates how to use the POM pattern to interact with web elements and perform actions.

- Easy Setup: Get started quickly by cloning this repository and customizing it for your project.

### Installation

- Create a new repo with this template repository
- Clone this template repo on your local machine
- navigate to that local repo and run command "npm i" to install all the dependencies
- run command "npx cypress run" to run the sample test suite.
- modify the pages objects and tests according to your needs

### How to Use POM in Cypress:

#### Create Page Objects:

- Identify the UI elements relevant to your tests (e.g., input fields, buttons, links).
- Create a separate JavaScript file for each page or component under test.
- Define methods in each page object to interact with the corresponding UI elements (e.g., clicking a button, entering text).

#### Use Page Objects in Tests:

- Import the page objects into your test files.
- Use the methods defined in the page objects to interact with the UI elements.
- Write your test logic focusing on the high-level actions rather than low-level DOM interactions.

#### Organize Test Code:

- Group related tests into test suites based on the functionality being tested.
- Use descriptive test and method names to improve readability.
- Keep the test files concise and focused on specific scenarios.

#### Maintaining Page Objects:

- Regularly update page objects as the UI changes.
- Ensure that the page objects accurately represent the current state of the application.
- Refactor page objects to remove duplication and improve readability.
